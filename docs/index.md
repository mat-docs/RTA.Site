# Telemetry Visualization for Engineering Projects

**[McLaren ATLAS](https://www.mclaren.com/applied/catalogue/item/atlas/)** is a vital tool for engineering projects with demanding telemetry requirements.

ATLAS is ubiquitous in Formula One, and widely used across other motorsport and in automotive industry.  
Engineers use ATLAS for development, simulation and monitoring for a diverse range of mission-critical systems.

=== "Typical Acquisition Sources"

    * ECUs ([Engine Control Units](https://www.mclaren.com/applied/catalogue/item/electronic-control-unit-tag-320B/)) &mdash; typically up to 1 KHz
    * Dedicated loggers for [high-resolution measurement](https://www.mclaren.com/applied/catalogue/item/hsl-500-high-speed-data-logger/) &mdash; typically up to 400 KHz
    * Virtual hardware, running embedded software under emulation
    * Engine Dynos
    * Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test-benches
    * Human-in-the-loop driving simulators

=== "Sensor Inputs"

    * Aerodynamic pressure sensors and pitot tubes
    * Brake-by-wire and regenerative braking
    * Power electronics and hybrid systems
    * Pneumatics, hydraulics and fuel
    * Embedded software
    * Human performance

ATLAS is now available for general engineering use, and integrates with your existing acquisition and storage infrastructure.
